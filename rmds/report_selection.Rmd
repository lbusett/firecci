# Report on processing for sampling L8 tessels

This document is used to report results of processing focused on automatically
sampling L8 tessels for fireCCI validation activities. 

## Input data

Data used are the results of the analysis done using the "plot_longseries.R"
script. 

```{r import, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
load(infile)
knitr::kable(in_data)
```

## Identification of the number of samples to take for each stratun (biome x 
Fire Intensity)

For each tessel, we first of all computed the total 2018 burnt area starting from 
the fireCCI raster.
